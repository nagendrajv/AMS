Application Management System
=============================

Application Management System is a web based tool for managing application releases, resources(servers, schemas...etc) and dependent apps. This is built based on my ideas and welcome anyone interested to take it to next level.

I created this tool quickly in summer 2012 based on my experiences and ideas. I haven't followed any coding practises or standards and built using JSP's, Java, MYSQL, HTML & JavaScript. 

Majority of my time went into collecting my ideas on what I need to accomplish and how the screens should like and creating a supporting database design.
